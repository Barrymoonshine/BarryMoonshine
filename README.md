Hey, I’m Nick.

I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer based in Bristol, UK. Before moving into engineering I worked as a Product Manager, which gave me a lasting interest in how technology can solve real‑world problems while balancing customer needs, business goals and the inevitable trade‑offs.

Most of my experience is on the backend, working with TypeScript (Node.js) and C# (ASP.NET), and using Datadog for monitoring and observability. I'm also comfortable using Python for scripts with various libraries. I hold AWS and MongoDB certifications and have worked with React and Next.js on the front end — using TypeScript across the stack.
